## ğŸ”­ How I implement 

### Operation with post ğŸ“• 
- ğŸŒ± Create *subject* ```update```, which emit a function that change the posts[]
- ğŸŒ± Use ```scan``` method to create a stream, contain ```posts[]``` after updated by this function

### Limit amount of posts each time loaded.ğŸ“• 
- ğŸŒ± Create an ```observable1$``` emit a value when scroll to bottom of page
- ğŸŒ± Create an ```observable2$``` to load post
- ğŸŒ± Use ```exhaustMap``` from ```RxJS```, so that when I scroll to bottom, it emits a value. After that, it will subscribe observable that load posts. If user keep scrolling to bottom, the value emit from ```observable1$``` will be skipped, don't create a lot request to server.
